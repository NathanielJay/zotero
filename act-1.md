# Adding Browser and Word Connectors

In this exercise you will:
- Add the browser connector so you can automatically download source information from websites
- Install the Word plugin so you can add citations to your papers

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this, please ask your instructor for assistance. Have fun!
